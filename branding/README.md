# Rafi Media Branding Example

This folder contains an example stylesheet to customize Jellyfin's appearance.
To apply it, create a `config/branding.json` file alongside your server
configuration containing:

```json
{
  "CustomCss": "branding/rafi.css"
}
```

Restart the server after creating the file.
